<p>Hello World is the most basic of programs. It's the first program people
  are taught when they start programming. It's a simple program, one that just
  outputs some text. The text doesn't have to be "Hello World" obviously. I've
  also seen where a date was outputed instead of "Hello World". However you
  wish to introduce someone to a programming language is up to you. But this is an
  easy goto.</p>

<p>I always wondered why a hello world was necessary and not a goodbye world. I
  mean you could easily type it out saying goodbye instead of hello, right?</p>

<pre>
public class GoodbyeWorld {

  public staitc void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Goodbye World");
  }
